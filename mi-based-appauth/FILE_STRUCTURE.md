## Quick Start

### Phase 1 (App Registration Baseline)
1. Follow setup instructions in main README.md
2. Deploy using `api_app_phase1.py` and `client_app_phase1.py`
3. Test role-based authorization

### Phase 2 (Managed Identity + PlainID)
1. Create managed identities as documented
2. Configure PlainID policies from `plainid-config/`
3. Deploy using `api_app_phase2.py` and `client_app_phase2.py`
4. Test fine-grained authorization

## Key Benefits Achieved

✅ **Eliminated app registration dependencies**  
✅ **Reduced security team bottlenecks**  
✅ **Fine-grained, context-aware authorization**  
✅ **Simplified token management**  
✅ **Better audit and compliance capabilities**  
✅ **Zero downtime migration path**  

## Next Steps

1. Review the main README.md for detailed implementation
2. Adapt the example code to your specific requirements
3. Configure PlainID policies based on your business rules
4. Plan your migration using the provided guide
5. Monitor and optimize based on your usage patterns
